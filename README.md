# Webther
Webther is a cute desktop app where the user can look up the weather in any place of the world. I got inspired by a similar project I saw on social media, so I wanted to recreated it but with my own style.
I built it using the framework Electron, and the open source API OpenWeather.

### Why choosing these technologies ?
Electron is a framework that is used for desktop applications like Discord, so I decided it would be a good framework to use for my app. For the API, I chose OpenWeather because it's open source and free, and the documentation thoroughly explain how to use this API.
